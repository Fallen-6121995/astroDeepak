            <p>A Coach. Friend. Spiritual Growth Catalyst.</p>

            <p>
              I coach senior leaders, CEOs, entrepreneurs and coaches to help
              them connect with themselves at a deeper level and become their
              best version. I am a mom of two teenagers, an author, blogger,
              dancer and podcaster. A curious explorer of the miracle called
              life.
            </p>

            <p>But above all thisâ€¦ I am a space holder. I am pure presence.</p>

            <p>
              I work as a catalyst to help you connect with your highest
              potential, with deep inner peace, magic and the source within. My
              deep connection with myself and the universe is my life's work and
              that's what I bring to everyone I work with. Coaching with me is a
              deep dive into knowing yourself, discovering and sometimes
              reinventing yourself.
            </p>
            <p>I am a sacred space of listening with no judgement.</p>
            <p>
              In this space of listening, love & support, you grow and evolve
              beyond you've ever imagined. You start to trust yourself and the
              universe even more. Miracles happen in your life.
